# Webhook Analytics System Implementation

## Overview

This feature branch implements a comprehensive webhook analytics system for capturing and analyzing all Dwolla webhook events in real-time. The system tracks user journeys, provides actionable insights, and handles edge cases for production reliability.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Webhook Reception Layer**
   - Multi-region load balancing
   - Signature verification
   - Deduplication
   - < 100ms ACK guarantee

2. **Event Storage & Processing**
   - Complete event capture
   - Out-of-order handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Dead letter queue

3. **Journey Tracking**
   - Configurable journey definitions
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Conflict resolution
   - Abandonment detection

4. **Analytics Engine**
   - Real-time metrics (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h windows)
   - Anomaly detection
   - Predictive analytics
   - Statistical analysis

5. **Reconciliation System**
   - Gap detection
   - Missing event recovery
   - Journey repair
   - API comparison

6. **UI Dashboard**
   - Real-time event feed
   - Journey monitoring
   - Analytics visualizations
   - Alert management

- [ ] Documentation

## Key Features

### Real-time Processing
- WebSocket/SSE for live updates
- Redis for hot data caching
- Streaming analytics
- Instant alerting

### Edge Case Handling
- Network failures
- Duplicate events
- Out-of-order processing
- Volume spikes
- System degradation

### Production Reliability
- Circuit breakers
- Graceful degradation
- Auto-scaling
- Multi-region deployment
- Disaster recovery

## Success Metrics

- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime
- **Performance**: < 100ms webhook ACK
- **Scale**: 10,000 events/second
- **Data Integrity**: 100% capture rate

## Development Guidelines

1. All code must include comprehensive error handling
2. Every component needs unit tests
3. Performance benchmarks for critical paths
4. Security review before merge
5. Documentation for all APIs

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Every function/method
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end flows
3. **Load Tests**: 10x normal volume
4. **Chaos Tests**: Failure scenarios
5. **Security Tests**: Penetration testing

## Deployment Strategy

1. Feature flags for gradual rollout
2. Canary deployment (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
3. Automated rollback on errors
4. Blue-green deployment ready

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Disable webhook processing
2. Queue events for later processing
3. Revert to previous version
4. Process queued events after fix
