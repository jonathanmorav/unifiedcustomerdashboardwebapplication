## Incident Classification

### Priority Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **P1 - Critical** | Active breach, data exposure, system compromise | < 15 minutes | Data breach, ransomware, system takeover |

## Immediate Response Actions

### üö® P1 Critical Incident Response

```bash
# 1. CONTAIN - Stop the bleeding
./scripts/emergency-lockdown.sh

# 2. ASSESS - Understand the scope
./scripts/security-assessment.sh

# 3. COMMUNICATE - Alert stakeholders
./scripts/alert-stakeholders.sh P1

# 4. PRESERVE - Capture evidence
./scripts/capture-evidence.sh
```

### Step-by-Step Response

#### 1. Initial Detection (0-5 minutes)

- [ ] Verify the incident is real (not a false positive)
- [ ] Classify incident severity (P1-P4)
- [ ] Create incident ticket with initial details
- [ ] Alert on-call security engineer
- [ ] Start incident timeline documentation

#### 2. Containment (5-15 minutes)

**For Active Breach:**
```bash
# Block suspicious IPs immediately
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <suspicious-ip> -j DROP

# Disable compromised accounts
npm run security:disable-accounts <user-ids>

# Enable emergency mode (read-only)
npm run security:emergency-mode on

# Revoke all active sessions if needed
npm run security:revoke-all-sessions
```

**Containment Checklist:**
- [ ] Isolate affected systems
- [ ] Disable compromised accounts
- [ ] Block malicious IPs/domains
- [ ] Revoke suspicious API keys
- [ ] Enable enhanced logging
- [ ] Take affected services offline if necessary

#### 3. Investigation (15-60 minutes)

**Data Collection Commands:**
```bash
# Export recent audit logs
npm run security:export-logs --hours=24 --severity=all

# Check for data exfiltration
npm run security:check-exports --user=<userid> --days=7

# Analyze session anomalies
npm run security:session-analysis --anomaly-level=high

# Review access patterns
npm run security:access-report --suspicious-only
```

**Investigation Questions:**
- What was accessed/modified?
- When did the incident start?
- How did the attacker gain access?
- What is the scope of compromise?
- Is the attack ongoing?
- What data was potentially exposed?

#### 4. Eradication (1-4 hours)

- [ ] Remove attacker access
- [ ] Patch vulnerabilities
- [ ] Reset compromised credentials
- [ ] Clean infected systems
- [ ] Update security rules
- [ ] Deploy security patches

#### 5. Recovery (2-8 hours)

**Recovery Steps:**
```bash
# Restore from clean backups if needed
npm run restore:from-backup --timestamp=<pre-incident>

# Re-enable services gradually
npm run services:enable --staged

# Reset user passwords
npm run security:force-password-reset --scope=affected

# Regenerate API keys
npm run security:rotate-api-keys

# Clear suspicious sessions
npm run security:clear-sessions --suspicious
```

#### 6. Post-Incident (24-48 hours)

- [ ] Complete incident report
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem meeting
- [ ] Implement lessons learned
- [ ] Update security procedures
- [ ] Notify affected users (if required)
- [ ] File regulatory reports (if required)
