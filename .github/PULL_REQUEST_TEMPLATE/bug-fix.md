## Bug Fix Pull Request

### 🐛 Bug Description
<!-- Describe the bug that was fixed -->

### 🔧 Solution
<!-- Describe how the bug was fixed -->

### 🔄 Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] **Date Mutation Issue**: Was this bug caused by mutating Date objects?
  - If yes, explain how immutable patterns were implemented
  - Verify all date operations now create new instances
- [ ] **Pagination Duplication**: Was this bug caused by duplicated pagination logic?
  - If yes, explain how existing components were leveraged
  - Verify no new pagination logic was created unnecessarily
- [ ] **Status Consistency**: Was this bug related to "completed" vs "processed" status?
  - If yes, confirm all status references use "processed"
  - Verify database and API consistency
- [ ] Other root cause: _______________

### 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Bug is reproducible in the original state
- [ ] Fix resolves the issue completely
- [ ] No regression introduced
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Added automated test to prevent regression

### 🔍 Common Bug Patterns Checked
- [ ] **Date Mutations**: Verified no Date objects are being mutated
  ```typescript
  // ❌ Bug-prone pattern
  // const date = new Date()
  // date.setDate(date.getDate() + 1)
  
  // ✅ Correct pattern
  // const nextDate = addDays(new Date(), 1)
  ```
- [ ] **Pagination Logic**: Confirmed no duplicate pagination code exists
- [ ] **Status Values**: All status references use current values ("processed" not "completed")
- [ ] **State Management**: No direct state mutations
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: Event listeners and subscriptions properly cleaned up
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: Async operations properly handled
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling implemented

**⚠️ Bug Fix Reminders:**
1. **Avoid Date mutations** - Primary source of date-related bugs
2. **Reuse pagination components** - Don't create duplicate logic
3. **Use "processed" status** - Not "completed"
4. **Add regression tests** - Prevent the bug from returning
