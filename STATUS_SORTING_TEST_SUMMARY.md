# Status Sorting Test Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: Step 6 - Refactor sorting logic for new status label

### Objective

Ensure that `SortField 'status'` still orders correctly by the new "processed" string after the migration from "completed" to "processed" status.

### Analysis Performed

1. **Examined existing codebase** - Found that status sorting is already implemented in:
   - `components/search/SortingControls.tsx` - UI component for sort controls
   - `lib/types/search.ts` - Type definitions including `SortField` enum with 'status'
   - `app/api/ach/transactions/route.ts` - API route with 'status' as valid sortBy parameter

2. **Verified current implementation** - The sorting logic uses:
   - Prisma's `orderBy` clause at the database level for actual sorting
   - String-based alphabetical comparison for JavaScript-level sorting
   - No custom sorting logic that would break with the status change

3. **Confirmed no code changes needed** - The existing sorting functionality works correctly with "processed" status because:
   - Database sorting is string-based and works with any status value
   - "processed" sorts alphabetically after "pending" and before "returned"
   - The SortField enum already includes 'status' as a valid option

### Test Implementation

Created comprehensive test file: `__tests__/unit/api/ach/status-sorting.test.ts`

#### Test Coverage Includes:

1. **String sorting behavior verification**:
   - Alphabetical sorting of status strings (ascending/descending)
   - Specific verification that "processed" sorts after "pending"
   - Confirmation that "processed" sorts before "returned"

2. **Transaction sorting with processed status**:
   - Sorting arrays of transactions by status field
   - Filtering processed transactions specifically
   - Mixed status transaction sorting

3. **Type compatibility verification**:
   - Confirmation that 'status' is valid SortField
   - Confirmation that 'processed' is valid TransferStatus

4. **Integration verification**:
   - API route parameter validation
   - Expected Prisma query structure
   - Filter condition usage

### Test Results

- **13 tests** implemented and **all passing**
- Tests verify that sorting works correctly with the new "processed" status
- Existing integration tests continue to pass (verified)

### Key Findings

- **No code changes required** - existing sorting logic already handles "processed" status correctly
- **Database-level sorting** ensures consistent behavior across the application
- **"processed" status sorts appropriately** in the alphabetical sequence:
  - `cancelled → failed → pending → processed → returned`

### Files Created/Modified

1. **New**: `__tests__/unit/api/ach/status-sorting.test.ts` - Comprehensive status sorting tests
2. **New**: `STATUS_SORTING_TEST_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Conclusion

✅ **Task Complete**: The existing `SortField 'status'` functionality works correctly with the new "processed" status label. Comprehensive tests have been added to verify this behavior and prevent regression.

The migration from "completed" to "processed" does not impact sorting functionality since the system uses string-based sorting which naturally accommodates the new status value.
